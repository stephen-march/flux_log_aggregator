# These are the deisred valve positions in mils (As,Sb) and temps in degrees C (group IIIs, rare earths, and Bi)
# to be used for the linear (As,Sb) and exponential (group IIIs, rare earths, and Bi) fits
# so that data can be compared equally as a function of time
#
# Keep the format below or elese it cannot be correctly read by the flux aggregator script!
#
# The date range returns flux data between the dates specified
#
# The r2 value is the R^2 regression fitting lower limit. It is used to save data that produces regressions
# that are greater than or equal to the r2 value. 
#
# The BEPorTemp variable determines if you want to fit to a given temperature/valve position or to a BEP.
# For example, selecting Temp uses the user-defined BEP values to find a particular cell/cracker's
# temperature/valve position at that corresponding BEP.
#
# If you decide to add any new elements, the regex commands in the flux aggregator script must be updated and
# you must pick the type of curve fitting (exponential vs. linear) to perform. This resides in the
# 'printing a hash and curve fitting' section of the script.
