# These are the deisred valve positions in mils (As,Sb) and temps in degrees C (group IIIs, rare earths, and Bi)
# to be used for the linear (As,Sb) and exponential (group IIIs, rare earths, and Bi) fits
# so that data can be compared equally as a function of time
#

# As and Sb
As valve position = 200
Sb valve position = 200

# Group IIIs
Al temp = 1150
B temp = 999
Ga temp = 1030
In temp = 900

# Bi
Bi temp = 600

# rare earth
Er temp = 1000
La temp = 1000
Lu temp = 1000
